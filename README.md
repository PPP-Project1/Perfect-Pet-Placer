# Perfect-Pet-Placer

Description

Perfect Pet Places is an application to find a pets that have been dislocated or pets that need to be adopted in the city or state where you live. There are an estimated 6.3 million animals that end up in animal shelters nationwide each year. Last year was an unprecedented year that brought a lot of uncertainty and extra time spent in our homes. This prompted a nationwide adoption spree wherein people began searching for solace in animals to help keep sane and stable during such a chaotic and stressful time. This also caused the  adoption rate for dogs and cats increase by 9%! This boom also slowed down euthanasia rates in shelters across the US because people were reportedly turning to animals for relief. Statics also showed that having an animal companion helped us ride the pandemic wave much better and it reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Well even though the pandemic is not over, our lives are opening up and changing once again. We have seen that these animals brought us joy and comfort to their new owners, but now there is also an emotional and financial burden on these individuals who have to return to the workplace. People are now finding ways to get out of their homes to return to work and social activities. This is causing a lot of stress on our pets. These pets are now developing separation anxiety when left alone because they are so used to the family unit being with them all the time. We are beginning to see less adoptions and people are finding that they are not able to spend the quality time with their animals as they were during the pandemic. As work patterns shift, the question that is now at the forefront is who will take care of the animals we now have to leave behind for 8 - 10 hours a day. Both the pet and the owner suffer. 

That is why we created this app! We want people who can find time to give to their love and attention to animals to consider adoption to help these animals find a good home. There are people who canâ€™t care for their animal anymore that would love to give over their animal to someone who will love them the way they do! 
This app will allow you to select what type of animal you are searching for, whether it be a dog, cat, bird or rabbit. You will then select what age, gender, size, hair length, zip code you are searching in and the radius of your search. The search will show you the name and location of the animal and will allow you to get more information about the animal you are interested in. Once you have chosen your new animal, you can contact the owner and go pick up your animal! 

The app was built using the following technologies:
    HTML
    CSS
    Bootstrap
    Javascript 
    JQuery
    Google Map API
    Pet Finder API

1. User is able to search using PetFinder API the type of animal such as a dog, cat, bird or rabbit. They can select age, gender, size, hair length, zip code and radius of the search.
