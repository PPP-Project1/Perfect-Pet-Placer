                        Did you know that an estimated 6.3 million animals end up in U.S. animal shelters nationwide each year? Of those 6.3 million, it is approximated that 920,000 of them are euthanized.
                        
                        Help us, help you, be a part of ending the cycle! Each year an astounding 4 million animals are adopted out of shelters, but that is still leaving 2 million without homes, join us in lowering that number and bring home a fur-family member today!
                        
                        Owning a pet has been shown to reduce feelings of loneliness, reduce stress as well as anxiety! Want a low maintenance fur-baby? A feline might be your perfect pet, often independent and quiet, they’re amazing for those short on time, but not on love. 
                        Do you need to get moving? Bring home a canine, to get you on your feet and out the door and often making new friends along the way!
                        
                        Also please use the extensive list of shelters and rescues in your area as a resource and safe space to bring found or abandoned animals, because it has been reported that almost 800,000 animals who enter shelters as strays are returned to their owners, and we want to make sure that Fido makes it back home safe and sound!
